# Task: Update Student Information in JSON

# You have a JSON file with student details, including name, age, and location.

# Your task is to create a program where the user can update the student information (e.g., update the name, age, or location of a student) by specifying the studentâ€™s name.

# After the update, save the new information back into the JSON file.

# Steps:

# Load the JSON data from the file.

# Ask the user to input the student's name whose details they want to update.

# Allow the user to choose which detail they want to update (name, age, or location).

# Update the chosen detail with the new value.

# Save the updated data back to the JSON file.

# with open('student.json') as f:
#     data1=json.load(f)
#     n=input("Enter the student name: ")
#     for i in data1:
#         if n==i["name"]:
#             new_name=input("Enter the new name")
#             i["name"]=new_name
# with open('student.json','w') as f:
#     json.dump(data1,f,indent=2)
#     print(data1)

# Task: Remove a student from the JSON file.
# Objective: Write a program that allows a user to remove a student from the student.
# json file by their name. If the student exists, remove them and update the JSON file.
# If the student is not found, display a message indicating that the student could not be found.
